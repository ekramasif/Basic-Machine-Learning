    - This course will cover search engine technologies, which play an important role in any data mining applications involving text data for two reasons. First, while the raw          data may be large for any particular problem, it is often a relatively small subset of the data that are relevant, and a search engine is an essential tool for quickly          discovering a small subset of relevant text data in a large text collection. Second, search engines are needed to help analysts interpret any patterns discovered in            the data by allowing them to examine the relevant original text data to make sense of any discovered pattern. You will learn the basic concepts, principles, and the            major techniques in text retrieval, which is the underlying science of search engines.
